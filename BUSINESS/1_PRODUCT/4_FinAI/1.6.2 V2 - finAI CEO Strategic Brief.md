# finAI CEO Strategic Brief
**Document Owner:** CEO  
**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025  
**Purpose:** Định nghĩa chiến lược 5–10 năm, moat, portfolio of bets, và guardrails cho Product Manager

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**finAI Vision (2035):** 30–50% financial professionals dùng finAI làm default research environment; Bloomberg/FactSet tích hợp finAI agent; $100M+ ARR, category leadership "Financial Intelligence Browser".

**Strategic Thesis:** Browsing for finance ≠ browsing for web. Financial workflows cần provenance, compliance, multi-source synthesis. Chúng ta rebuild browsing từ first principles cho vertical này.

**3 Core Moats:**
1. Data network effects (workflow patterns)
2. Compliance-first architecture (hard to retrofit)
3. Vertical brand trust (finance-native)

**Portfolio (70-20-10):**
- 70% Core: Research Agent Extension (0–18 tháng)
- 20% Adjacent: Enterprise tier + Agent Marketplace (12–48 tháng)
- 10% Transform: Trading Copilot + Financial OS (3–10 năm)

**Capital Plan:** Bootstrap → $10K MRR (6 tháng) → Seed $2M (12 tháng) → Series A $10M (24 tháng)

---

## PART I: FIRST PRINCIPLES & VISION (The WHY)

### 1. First Principles Breakdown

#### Fundamental Truths (không thể bẻ cong)

**Truth #1: Financial workflows ≠ Consumer workflows**
- Consumer web: 1 page = 1 task (search, shop, read)
- Finance research: 1 idea = 10–50 tab (10-K, earnings, news, screener, broker report, comp analysis)
- Current browsing: mở tab → copy-paste → Excel/Notion → tự tổng hợp = **cực kỳ inefficient**

**Truth #2: Accuracy + Provenance = Table stakes**
- Consumer AI: 95% accuracy có thể accept
- Finance: 1 sai số = trust destroyed, deal loss, fiduciary liability
- Mọi kết luận phải: **source + reasoning + confidence score**

**Truth #3: Generic agentic browsers fail finance**
- Comet, Atlas, Dia: optimize cho shopping, travel, general research
- Không hiểu finance semantics (XBRL, ratios, covenants)
- Không integrate broker, portfolio, compliance

#### The Assumption We're Breaking

**Assumption cũ:** "Browsers must be general-purpose. One browser for everything."

**Truth mới:** "Vertical workflows need vertical browsers. Finance browser ≠ general browser."

**Rebuild from scratch:**
- Input layer: Understand financial documents (10-K, earnings, filings)
- Processing: Extract metrics, flag risks, validate multi-source
- Output: 1-page investment snapshot with full provenance
- Compliance: Audit trail, "research tool" not "advisor"

---

### 2. 10-Year Vision

#### By 2035, finAI will be:

**Customer Outcome:**
- Financial professionals make **10× faster, 100× more informed** decisions
- Research 1 stock = <30 minutes (not 5 hours)
- Zero trust erosion (every number traceable)

**Market State:**
- 30–50% analysts/advisors use finAI daily
- Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet integrate finAI agent layer
- "Financial Intelligence Browser" = recognized category (như "cloud computing" 2010)

**Company Position:**
- Category leader, $100M+ ARR
- 50K–100K paid users, 500+ employees
- Moat unassailable: data network + compliance + brand

#### Vision Statement (2 sentences)

> "finAI rebuilds web browsing from first principles for financial professionals. By 2035, we are the default research platform globally, enabling 10× faster decisions with 100× more confidence through AI-native, compliance-ready workflows."

#### Vision Characteristics

- **Long-term:** 5–10 years (stable anchor)
- **Inspirational:** Attracts top talent & VC
- **Specific enough:** Guides strategy (không vague)
- **Broad enough:** Allows innovation (không rigid)

---

## PART II: ENDURING COMPETITIVE MOAT (The HOW WE WIN)

### 1. 3-Layer Moat Strategy

#### Layer 1: Data & Network Effects Moat

**Mechanism:**
- Every user interaction = training signal
  - Annotation, feedback, "this was wrong"
  - Portfolio outcome (which analysis → good decision)
- After 3 years, 10K+ users: finAI trained on **proprietary financial workflows**

**Network Effect:**
- Portfolio intelligence: "What's your peer base buying?"
- More users → better AI → more users (exponential)

**Defensibility:** 9/10  
**Timeline to build:** 3–5 years  
**How to widen:**
- Year 1: 1K users, basic workflow data
- Year 2: 5K users, portfolio patterns emerge
- Year 3: 10K users, network effects kick in (peer insights valuable)

---

#### Layer 2: Compliance-first Architecture Moat

**Mechanism:**
- Built from day 1: no investment advice, only research support
- Explainable outputs, logged, audit trail, data governance
- "Research tool" positioning = no RIA license needed (legal opinion day 1)

**Why hard to retrofit:**
- Bloomberg/Microsoft want to add AI agent → compliance nightmare
- Retrofitting = 12–18 months legal + engineering
- finAI = compliance-native, can move faster

**Defensibility:** 7/10  
**Timeline:** 1–2 years (do it from MVP)  
**How to widen:**
- Year 1: Legal framework, E&O insurance, disclaimers
- Year 2: Exclusive RIA partnerships (co-brand), enterprise compliance dashboard
- Year 3: Compliance = selling point for regulated firms

---

#### Layer 3: Domain Brand & Vertical Moat

**Mechanism:**
- "Built by finance professionals, for finance professionals"
- Brand trust = existential in regulated industry
- One hallucination scandal from generic AI = trust destroyed

**Positioning advantage:**
- Narrow focus = deeper expertise perception
- Generic AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity) = consumer brand, low finance trust
- finAI = specialist, like how CRM for finance ≠ generic CRM

**Defensibility:** 8/10  
**Timeline:** 3–5 years (build through correct positioning + zero incidents)  
**How to widen:**
- Year 1: Community (FinTwit), thought leadership (blog on finance AI)
- Year 2: Case studies (XYZ hedge fund saves 10h/week)
- Year 3: Awards, conference speaking, "finAI = standard"

---

### 2. Moat-Building Roadmap

| Year | Primary Moat Focus | Actions | Defensibility Target |
|------|-------------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Y1** | Data + Compliance | 1K users, proprietary financial doc parsing, legal framework | 6/10 |
| **Y2** | Compliance + Brand | Broker integrations, portfolio monitoring, zero incidents, RIA partnerships | 7/10 |
| **Y3** | Network Effects | 10K users, portfolio intelligence live, peer insights, community | 8/10 |
| **Y4-5** | All 3 layers | 50K users, enterprise tier, agent marketplace, adjacent verticals | 9/10 |

---

### 3. Asymmetric Advantages vs Big Tech

**Why Bloomberg/Microsoft/Google struggle to compete:**

| Challenge for Big Tech | Why finAI wins |
|------------------------|---------------|
| **Compliance = slow** | Legal risk-averse orgs take 12–18 months to approve AI product; finAI moves fast with "research tool" positioning |
| **Generic DNA** | MSFT/Google optimize for broad use cases; can't go deep enough in finance semantics (XBRL, covenants, ratios) |
| **Brand perception** | Consumer AI brand ≠ finance brand; "ChatGPT for finance" = low trust; finAI = specialist |
| **Organizational inertia** | Bloomberg doesn't want to cannibalize terminal ($2K/mo); finAI = direct attack on pain point |

---

## PART III: PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC BETS (Resource Allocation)

### 1. McKinsey 70-20-10 Framework

**70% CORE (Horizon 1: 0–18 tháng) – Must Win**

**Bet #1: Research Agent Extension (MVP)**
- **Hypothesis:** Analysts will pay $100–300/mo for tool that saves 10h/week
- **Resources:** $500K, 5 people (1 AI lead, 1 finance expert, 2 full-stack, 1 designer)
- **Timeline:** 18 months to PMF
- **Success metric:** 1K paid users, $10K MRR, NPS >40, <10% churn
- **Go/No-Go (Month 18):** If hit metrics → fund 20% bets. If miss → pivot or kill.

**Bet #2: Portfolio Monitoring Agent**
- **Hypothesis:** Daily driver (monitoring) = higher retention than one-off research
- **Resources:** $300K, 3 people
- **Timeline:** 12 months (parallel to Bet 1)
- **Success metric:** 50% of research users adopt; 20%+ WAU
- **Why:** Transforms finAI from "research tool" → "daily habit"

---

**20% ADJACENT (Horizon 2: 12–48 tháng) – Expand**

**Bet #3: Enterprise finAI (Multi-seat + Compliance Dashboard)**
- **Hypothesis:** Enterprise ARPU 5–10× higher than SMB; longer contract = better LTV
- **Resources:** $200K + sales team, 4–5 people
- **Timeline:** Launch after MVP PMF (Month 12–36)
- **Success metric:** 3–5 enterprise deals ($20–50K ACV), $500K ARR from enterprise
- **Why:** De-risk business model (not 100% reliant on individuals)

**Bet #4: Agent Marketplace (finAI-as-Platform)**
- **Hypothesis:** Platform = exponential value; remove constraint of "finAI can only build X agents"
- **Resources:** $100K + dev relations, 2 people
- **Timeline:** Month 18–30, launch marketplace MVP
- **Success metric:** 5–10 third-party agents live, $50–100K/mo marketplace revenue (20% take rate)
- **Why:** Leverage community; credit analyst agent, macro agent, ESG agent by third parties

---

**10% TRANSFORMATIONAL (Horizon 3: 24–60+ tháng) – Moonshots**

**Bet #5: Trading Execution Copilot (AI recommends, human executes)**
- **Hypothesis:** Trading market >> research market; if we can advise execution (without auto-execute), huge TAM
- **Resources:** $150K, 2 people
- **Timeline:** Month 24–48, beta for accredited users
- **Success metric:** 100–200 traders using beta; >80% approval rate on recommendations
- **Risk:** Regulatory (SEC), must be "recommendation" not "auto-execute"
- **Why:** If succeeds, 10× larger TAM; if fails, side bet (no big loss)

**Bet #6: Financial Intelligence OS (Moon-shot)**
- **Hypothesis:** finAI = unified intelligence layer on top of all financial systems (broker, CRM, portfolio mgmt, news)
- **Resources:** TBD (Year 4+)
- **Timeline:** 4–10 years
- **Success metric:** Integrated with 10+ major brokers/platforms; 1000+ institutions
- **Why:** Blue ocean; if research moat deep enough → can build OS

---

### 2. Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions (Bezos Framework)

**Type 1 (Irreversible – one-way door):** Slow, deliberate, CEO must approve

- **Vertical focus on finance** (pivot = restart company)
- **Compliance-first architecture** (retrofit = expensive)
- **Business model core** (freemium vs enterprise-first)

**Type 2 (Reversible – two-way door):** Fast, iterate, PM can decide

- Which features in MVP
- Pricing ($99 vs $149/mo)
- GTM channels (Twitter vs LinkedIn)
- UI/UX tweaks

**Speed principle:** Move fast on Type 2, slow on Type 1.

---

## PART IV: MARKET POSITION & EXPANSION (Beachhead → TAM)

### 1. Product Evolution Path

| Stage | Years | finAI State | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Feature** | 0–1 | Browser extension add-on | Acqui-hire exit ($5–20M) |
| **Product** | 1–3 | Standalone research platform | Exit to Bloomberg/FactSet ($50–200M) |
| **Platform** | 3–5 | Agent marketplace + API | IPO potential ($500M–1B valuation) |
| **Ecosystem** | 5–10 | Financial OS, developer community, data network | Multi-generational company ($5–10B+) |

**CEO Decision (Year 0):** Aim for Platform, not just Product. Build with ecosystem mindset from day 1.

---

### 2. Market Expansion (Geoffrey Moore)

**Beachhead (Y1-2):** Buy-side equity/credit analysts
- **Why:** Pain acute (8–9/10), WTP high ($150–300/mo), early adopters (tech-savvy)
- **TAM:** 50K analysts globally, $750M–1.5B market

**Adjacent 1 (Y2-3):** Independent financial advisors (RIA)
- **Why:** Similar pain, larger TAM, higher ARPU (serve multiple clients)
- **TAM:** 100K advisors, $1.5–3B market

**Adjacent 2 (Y3-4):** Corporate development teams (M&A analysts)
- **Why:** Research-heavy workflows, enterprise budget
- **TAM:** 50K corp dev professionals, $750M market

**TAM (Y5+):** All knowledge workers doing research
- **Why:** If finAI wins finance, expand to legal, consulting, healthcare research
- **TAM:** 5M+ knowledge workers, $50–100B market

---

### 3. Category Design: "Financial Intelligence Browser"

**Not:**
- "AI browser" (crowded, commodity, Comet/Atlas/Dia)
- "Finance tool" (boring, low margin, commodity SaaS)

**YES:**
- **"Financial Intelligence Browser"** – first agentic browser purpose-built for finance

**Category King = 76% market value (Play Bigger framework)**

**Category positioning:**
- 2026: "New category emerging"
- 2028: "finAI = category leader"
- 2030: "Financial Intelligence Browser = standard term in industry"

---

## PART V: BUSINESS MODEL EVOLUTION (Year 1 → Year 10)

### 1. Business Model by Stage

| Stage | Years | Model | Revenue Streams | Example ARR |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Y1-2** | 0–24 mo | B2B SaaS (freemium) | Subscription: Free → Pro ($99–149/mo) | $10K–500K ARR |
| **Y3-5** | 24–60 mo | Platform | SaaS + Marketplace take rate (20%) + Enterprise ($500–2K/mo/team) | $5M–50M ARR |
| **Y5-10** | 60–120 mo | Ecosystem | Usage-based pricing + API licensing + Data licensing + Enterprise deals | $100M–500M+ ARR |

---

### 2. Unit Economics (Target by Month 18)

| Metric | Target | Why it matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **ARPU** | $120/mo | Mix: 70% Pro ($99), 20% Pro+ ($149), 10% Enterprise (avg $600/seat) |
| **COGS** | $15/mo | GPT-4 API ($10) + hosting ($3) + support ($2) |
| **Gross Margin** | 87.5% | ($120 - $15) / $120 = healthy SaaS margin |
| **CAC** | $150 | Mix: Organic/Viral ($50), Content ($100), Paid ($300) |
| **LTV** | $1,440 | ARPU $120 × 12 months avg lifetime |
| **LTV:CAC** | 9.6:1 | Healthy (target >3:1) ✅ |
| **Payback Period** | 1.25 months | $150 CAC / ($120 - $15) = fast payback ✅ |

---

### 3. Path to $100M ARR (Reverse Engineering)

**$100M ARR = 100K paid users × $1K ARPU × 80% retention**

**Assumptions must hold:**
- **TAM:** 500K analysts globally × 20% penetration = 100K users
- **ARPU expansion:** Freemium $0 → Pro $99 → Pro+ $149 → Enterprise $500+ → avg $1K
- **Retention:** 80% Net Revenue Retention (upsell > churn)

**Milestones:**
- Year 1: 1K users, $120K ARR (0.1% of goal)
- Year 2: 5K users, $600K ARR (0.6%)
- Year 3: 10K users, $1.2M ARR (1.2%)
- Year 4: 30K users, $12M ARR (12%)
- Year 5: 50K users, $30M ARR (30%)
- Year 6-7: 100K users, $100M ARR ✅

---

## PART VI: TEAM & CULTURE (10-Year Hiring)

### 1. Culture Design (finAI DNA)

**4 Cultural Pillars (CEO must protect):**

1. **Finance domain respect** – Hire domain experts, not just tech generalists; finance workflows > tech for tech's sake
2. **AI excellence** – Best ML talent; high bar on model performance; ship weekly improvements
3. **Compliance-first** – No shortcuts; legal review before launch; trust = existential
4. **Speed within guardrails** – Fast iteration on Type 2 decisions; slow on Type 1

**Culture = Strategy's twin. Wrong culture → strategy fails.**

---

### 2. Stage-Based Hiring

| Stage | Team Size | Roles | Why |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Y0-1** (MVP) | 5 people | 1 AI lead, 1 finance expert, 2 full-stack, 1 designer | Generalists + domain experts; move fast |
| **Y1-3** (PMF → Scale) | 20 people | +Head of Product, +Sales lead, +Compliance counsel, +3 eng, +2 CS | Specialists + first leaders; build repeatable GTM |
| **Y3-5** (Platform) | 50 people | +CTO, +CFO, +CMO, +Head of Data, +10 eng, +5 sales, +3 marketing | C-suite; scale org with functional leaders |
| **Y5-10** (Ecosystem) | 200–500 | Full C-suite, VPs for eng/product/sales/marketing, regional teams | Multi-generational company structure |

**CEO's hiring principle:** Hire for next stage, not current. "Hire slow, fire fast."

---

## PART VII: CAPITAL & FINANCING STRATEGY

### 1. Fundraising Roadmap (7 năm)

| Stage | Timing | Amount | Valuation | Use of Funds | Key Metrics to Hit |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Bootstrap** | Month 0–6 | $0 | – | Validate PMF | $10K MRR, 100 beta users |
| **Seed** | Month 6–12 | $2M | $10M post | Scale to $100K MRR | $1M ARR, 1K paid users, NPS >40 |
| **Series A** | Month 24 | $10M | $50M post | Build platform (marketplace, enterprise) | $10M ARR, 10K users, clear moat |
| **Series B** | Month 48 | $50M | $200M post | Scale to category leader | $50M ARR, 50K users, expanding margin |

---

### 2. 2025 Fundraising Benchmarks (VCs expect)

| Round | Product | Users | MRR/ARR | Growth | Churn | Moat |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|--------|-------|------|
| **Seed** | MVP + PMF signal | 50–100 users | $10K MRR | – | – | Strong team + clear thesis |
| **Series A** | Product + clear GTM | 1K–5K users | $1–2M ARR | 100%+ YoY | <10% monthly | Defensible moat identified |
| **Series B** | Platform | 10K+ users | $10M ARR | 100%+ YoY | <5% monthly | Moat validated, category leader emerging |

---

### 3. Cap Table Management (CEO must protect)

**Principle:** Don't over-dilute early. Target: CEO + co-founders retain 50%+ post-Series A.

| Event | Dilution | Founder % remaining |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Founding | 0% | 100% (split among co-founders) |
| Seed ($2M @ $10M post) | 20% | 80% |
| Series A ($10M @ $50M post) | 20% | 64% (80% × 0.8) |
| Series B ($50M @ $200M post) | 25% | 48% (64% × 0.75) |

**Goal:** Retain control + meaningful equity through exit/IPO.

---

## PART VIII: RISK & RESILIENCE (Pre-Mortem)

### 1. 3 Existential Risks (CEO Pre-Mortem)

**Imagine: finAI failed in Year 3. What was the cause?**

#### Risk #1: Regulatory – "SEC shuts down for investment advice"

**Scenario:** finAI gives investment recommendation (even indirect) → user sues → SEC investigates → company shut down.

**Probability:** Medium (if positioning wrong)  
**Impact:** Game over

**Mitigation:**
- **Legal opinion day 1:** Clear "research tool" vs "investment advisor" positioning
- **No "buy/sell" recommendations:** Only "research snapshot" + "scenario analysis"
- **Disclaimers:** Every output = clear disclaimer
- **Insurance:** Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage
- **Partnership:** RIA review product positioning

---

#### Risk #2: Technical – "AI hallucination destroys trust"

**Scenario:** finAI extracts wrong number from 10-K (revenue $1M when it's $100M) → user makes bad decision → trust evaporates, brand damaged.

**Probability:** High (hallucination = real problem in financial LLMs)  
**Impact:** High (one incident = churn spike, potential lawsuit)

**Mitigation:**
- **Human-in-loop:** Always show source (quote from document) + confidence score
- **Validation layer:** Compare extracted numbers against multiple sources; flag conflicts
- **Testing:** Extensive validation on real financial documents before launch
- **Transparency:** Show reasoning; let user correct → training signal

---

#### Risk #3: Competitive – "Bloomberg/FactSet launches finAI killer"

**Scenario:** Year 2–3, big tech or incumbents notice finAI traction, launch copycat with unlimited resources.

**Probability:** Very high  
**Impact:** Medium-High (but moat protects if built right)

**Mitigation:**
- **Speed to moat:** Year 1–2, build data moat + compliance advantage fast
- **Vertical depth:** Go so deep in finance that copying = hard (Bloomberg doesn't want to move away from terminal paradigm)
- **Community:** Build developer community around agent marketplace before competitors enter

---

### 2. Strategic Optionality (Multiple Paths to Win)

**Plan A (Primary):** B2B SaaS to analysts/advisors → Platform → Ecosystem

**Plan B (Pivot option):** White-label to wealth management firms (licensing model)

**Plan C (Monetization option):** Data/API business to Bloomberg/FactSet (sell the intelligence layer, not end product)

**Why optionality matters:** Can pivot without restarting from zero. "Real options" thinking = CEO's advantage.

---

## PART IX: CEO DECISION FRAMEWORK

### 1. Strategic Decision Rubric

CEO uses this rubric for **all major decisions:**

| Criteria | Question | Weight |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Vision alignment** | Does this move us closer to 2035 vision? | 30% |
| **Moat deepening** | Does this widen our moat? | 25% |
| **Capital efficiency** | ROI > 3× benchmark? | 20% |
| **Risk mitigation** | Does this reduce existential risk? | 15% |
| **Team & culture** | Does this strengthen or weaken culture? | 10% |

**Score:** 1–10 per criteria → weighted avg → if <7, reject.

---

### 2. Go/No-Go Gates (CEO Approval Required)

| Gate | Month | CEO Question | Criteria | Decision |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Gate 1** | 2 | "Is this a 10-year opportunity?" | Vision clear, Problem validated (pain ≥8/10 for ≥80%) | GO / NO-GO |
| **Gate 2** | 4 | "Can we build a moat?" | Moat strategy identified, Prototype works | GO / NO-GO |
| **Gate 3** | 9 | "Is this defensible long-term?" | MBP validated (WTP ≥40%, time saved ≥3h), unit economics viable | GO / NO-GO |
| **Gate 4** | 18 | "Path to $100M ARR clear?" | PMF confirmed (1K users, $10K MRR, NPS ≥40), Growth loop working | GO / SCALE / PIVOT |

**At each gate:** CEO must see data + PM recommendation → approve/reject/ask for more info.

---

## PART X: HANDOFF TO PRODUCT MANAGER

### 1. What CEO Gives to PM (Strategic Guardrails)

**Document Package:**

1. **This Strategic Brief** (10–15 pages) – Read first
2. **Product Vision Statement** (1 page) – North Star
3. **ICP & Best Buyer Persona** (1 page) – Who we serve
4. **Moat Strategy** (2 pages) – Competitive advantage
5. **Portfolio of Bets** (1 page table) – Resource allocation
6. **No-Go Rules** (1 page) – What we will NOT do

**CEO → PM Meeting (1 hour):**
- Walk through Vision, Moat, Bets
- PM asks clarifying questions
- CEO sets KPIs for PM: "By Month 18, need 1K users, $10K MRR, NPS >40"

---

### 2. What PM Does Next (Execution)

**PM's Responsibilities (CEO does NOT micromanage):**

1. **Customer Discovery** (20 interviews, validate pain ≥8/10)
2. **MVP Scope** (1–2 killer use cases, not 10 features)
3. **Roadmap** (Now-Next-Later, 6-month plan)
4. **Execution** (sprint planning, ship weekly)
5. **Metrics** (track activation, retention, NPS, revenue)
6. **Insight Loop** (report back to CEO monthly: learnings, pivots needed)

**PM → CEO Monthly Report:**
- KPI dashboard
- User insights (pain, feedback, feature requests)
- Competitive intel
- Recommendations (pivot? double down? kill?)

CEO reviews → adjusts strategy if needed.

---

## PART XI: ACTION ITEMS (Next 30 Days)

### CEO Immediate Actions (Week 1–4)

**Week 1:**
- ✅ Finalize this Strategic Brief (share with co-founders for feedback)
- ✅ Identify 5 analyst/advisor connections for customer interviews (leverage network)
- ✅ Draft 1-page Product Vision Statement

**Week 2:**
- ✅ Legal consultation: "research tool" vs "investment advisor" positioning
- ✅ Set up Hypothesis Lab (Notion/Airtable) to track bets
- ✅ Recruit 1 finance expert advisor (ex-analyst from top fund) for product feedback

**Week 3:**
- ✅ CEO → PM handoff meeting (1 hour, walk through Strategic Brief)
- ✅ Approve PM's Customer Discovery plan (20 interviews, 2 weeks)
- ✅ Set Gate 1 (Month 2): criteria clear, metrics defined

**Week 4:**
- ✅ Start fundraising prep: draft Seed pitch deck outline (Problem-Solution-Market-Moat-Team)
- ✅ Identify 3 potential angel investors (fintech/AI background)
- ✅ CEO blog post #1: "Why finance needs vertical AI" (thought leadership, SEO)

---

## PART XII: SUMMARY – CEO MANTRAS

**5 Things CEO Must Protect:**

1. **Vision = Sacred** – Roadmap can change, vision doesn't. Remind team "Why we exist" quarterly.
2. **Moat First** – Every decision ask: "Does this widen our moat?" If no, deprioritize.
3. **Portfolio Thinking** – Balance 70-20-10. Don't all-in MVP; keep 10% for moonshots.
4. **Type 1 Slow, Type 2 Fast** – Know which decisions are irreversible (slow, CEO) vs reversible (fast, PM).
5. **Culture = Moat** – Wrong culture → strategy fails. Protect: Finance respect, AI excellence, Compliance-first, Speed.

---

**Document Status:** ✅ **READY FOR HANDOFF TO PM**

**Next Step:** CEO schedules 1-hour meeting with PM to walk through Strategic Brief + answer questions.
