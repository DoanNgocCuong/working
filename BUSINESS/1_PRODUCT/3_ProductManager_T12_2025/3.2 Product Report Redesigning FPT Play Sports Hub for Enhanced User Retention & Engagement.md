# Product Report: Redesigning FPT Play Sports Hub for Enhanced User Retention & Engagement

**Date**: December 2025  
**Product**: FPT Play Sports Streaming Platform  
**Target Segment**: Sports Enthusiasts (18–45 years) in Vietnam

---

## 1. Executive Summary

FPT Play's Sports section faces a critical retention challenge: **7-day retention sits at 23% versus a platform average of 45%**, with users averaging only **1.2 sessions per week** against an industry benchmark of 3.5. The core problem is an **experience gap between live viewing and post-match engagement**, forcing users to fragment their journey across YouTube, social media, and third-party stats platforms.

**Key Recommendation**: Transform the Sports page from a "content directory" into a **"Personalized Sports Hub"** that captures the full emotional arc of sports fandom—before, during, and after matches. The MVP will focus on **Focused Fans (25–34, paid subscribers)**, delivering a **Post-Match Hub** that integrates highlights, stats, and community interaction to increase session duration by 5–10 minutes and weekly frequency to 2.0 within 6 months.

## 2. Market Context & Opportunity

## 2.1 OTT & Pay-TV Market Growth

Vietnam's OTT market is undergoing a **major transition** from traditional TV to internet-based streaming:

- **OTT subscribers** grew from **5.56 million (2023) → 7.4 million (2024)**, a **33% increase**.[vietnamnews+1](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1721993/pay-tv-continues-to-decline-despite-ott-growth.html)​
    
- **Total pay-TV subscribers** (including IPTV, OTT) reached **21 million in 2024**, up **14% year-over-year**.[vietnamnet+1](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-s-pay-tv-subscribers-surge-to-21-million-in-2024-2328942.html)​
    
- **OTT revenue** hit nearly **1,700 billion VND in 2023**, growing **7% annually**.[news.laodong](https://news.laodong.vn/cong-nghe/doanh-thu-nganh-truyen-hinh-tra-tien-viet-nam-du-kien-dat-10300-ti-dong-1593431.ldo)​
    
- Users spend **~120 minutes daily** watching long-form OTT content, while short videos (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) add nearly another hour.[marketreport+1](https://marketreport.io/vietnam-in-view-2024)​
    

## 2.2 Sports Streaming Landscape

The market is **segmented by model**: SVOD (subscription), AVOD (ad-supported), TVOD (transactional), and hybrid. **SVOD leads** due to ad-free experiences and exclusive content. Primary end-users are **individual consumers**, though commercial and educational segments are growing.[statista+2](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/media/tv-video/ott-video/vietnam)​

**Key Insight**: The shift to mobile-first viewing (65% of FPT Sports users) and demand for flexible, on-demand content creates an opportunity to own the **entire sports fan journey**, not just live matches.

## 3. User Segmentation & Personas

## 3.1 Four Distinct User Quadrants

Based on **Content Breadth** (single vs. multi-sport) and **Engagement Level** (low vs. high interaction), we identify four segments:

|Segment|Content Breadth|Engagement|Behavior|Value to FPT|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Single-interest Passives**|Low (1 sport)|Low|Watch live, exit immediately|Short traffic spike, high churn risk|
|**Surfing Explorers**|High (multi-sport)|Low|Browse widely, short views|Good for ad impressions, low CLV|
|**Focused Fans**|Low (1 sport, football)|High|Watch live regularly, seek depth|**Core paid subscribers, retention target**|
|**All-around Enthusiasts**|High (multi-sport)|High|Watch live + highlights + analysis|**Highest CLV, potential brand ambassadors**|

## 3.2 Best Buyer: Focused Fans (Core Enthusiast)

**Why this segment?**

- **Pain Score**: 8–9/10 (severe post-match drop-off, fragmentation).
    
- **Frequency**: Daily to weekly usage during season.
    
- **Willingness to Pay**: 30% of total users, average CLV $36 (3-month subscription).paste.txt​
    
- **Behavioral Gap**: 7-day retention 23% vs. platform 45%; weekly sessions 1.2 vs. benchmark 3.5.paste.txt​
    

## 3.3 Persona: Anh T., 27, Marketing Manager

**Demographics**:

- Age: 27, urban professional, income middle-class.
    
- Devices: iPhone + Smart TV.
    
- Sports: Football fan (Manchester United), watches 3+ matches/week.
    

**Journey & Pain Points**:

1. **Pre-match**: Finds match schedule on Google, not in-app.
    
2. **Live**: Watches on FPT Play (stable, good quality).
    
3. **Post-match**: **Immediately exits** → YouTube for highlights, Facebook for fan reactions, Sofascore for stats.
    
4. **Off-days**: No reason to open FPT Play; content is generic and irrelevant.
    

**Core Need**: "I want to **live and breathe** my team's season without switching apps."

## 4. Problem Statement & Root Cause Analysis

## 4.1 The "Experience Gap"

**Problem Statement (A4 Format)**:  
_Focused Fans (25–34, paid subscribers) cannot sustain their sports passion between live matches because FPT Play lacks a post-match engagement layer, forcing them to fragment their experience across YouTube (highlights), social media (community), and third-party apps (stats). This results in 7-day retention dropping to 23% and weekly sessions stagnating at 1.2._

## 4.2 Five Whys Deep Dive

1. **Why do users exit after watching?** → No compelling content post-match.
    
2. **Why is there no compelling content?** → Homepage is static; no auto-surfacing of highlights, stats, or community.
    
3. **Why is content not surfaced?** → Poor information architecture; lack of personalization engine.
    
4. **Why is personalization missing?** → No "My Team" onboarding; metadata tagging is weak.
    
5. **Why is metadata weak?** → Product built as "video library," not "fan hub."
    

**Root Cause**: The Sports page is designed as a **passive content repository**, not an **active engagement platform**.

|---|---|---|---|
|**K+**|Exclusive EPL rights; premium brand|High price; limited non-EPL content|"Premium football destination"|

|**VieON**|Diverse entertainment ecosystem|Sports content secondary; no hub|"Super-app with sports"|

## 5.2 Indirect Competitors

- **YouTube**: Free, instant highlights, strong community → **eats 92% of post-match video views**.
    
- **Facebook**: Live chat, reactions, fan groups → **captures emotional release**.
    
- **Sofascore**: Real-time stats, deep data → **owns the "understand" job**.
    

**FPT's Competitive Edge**:

- **Official rights** for Asian & domestic leagues (AFC, V-League, Shopee Cup).
    
- **Vietnamese BLV personality** (humor, relatability) vs. K+'s formality.

**Gap**: No competitor offers **integrated post-match engagement + community** in Vietnam.

- **Match Alerts**: Pre-match, lineups, kick-off, goals.
    
- **Team Stats Dashboard**: Season performance, player rankings.
    
- **Fan Community**: Moderated chat/comments with fellow supporters.
    

**Concept 3: In-Match Interaction Layer (Quick Win)**

## 10. Conclusion & Next Steps

FPT Play's Sports section has **untapped potential** among Focused Fans who crave a **complete, personalized fan experience**. The current "watch-and-leave" model leaks users to fragmented platforms. By launching a **Post-Match Hub** and **My Team Feed**, we can capture 5–10 extra minutes per session, driving weekly frequency from 1.2 to 2.5 and retention from 23% to 35%.

**Immediate Next Steps**:

1. **Week 1 (Dec 9–13)**: Finalize Problem Statement A4, recruit 20 Focused Fans for interviews.
    
2. **Week 2 (Dec 14–20)**: Conduct interviews, build Insight Map & OST, prioritize 3 MBP concepts.
    
3. **Week 3 (Dec 21–27)**: Design wireframes, run user tests, lock MBP scope.
    
4. **Week 4 (Jan 2–10)**: Kick off development sprints for Post-Match Hub.
    

**Success hinges on**:

- **Speed**: 4-week MBP cycles, not 6-month specs.
    
- **Focus**: Serve Focused Fans first; ignore non-core segments initially.
    
- **Data**: Every decision backed by pain score, frequency, and RICE scoring.
