January 2017.

How to get them to say yes, after they say no

I had a rough 90 days. My grandfather died. My mother was in the hospital from

a life-threatening injury.

After four years of building and selling my first five gyms, my

business partner drained our accounts and hid the money overseas, and... as the cherry

on top, I got into a head-on collision, landing myself a DUI and some time to think... in

a jail cell.

And the person I least expected came to get me. Leila.

Then, my girlfriend of

only six months, already acting like a ride-or-die.

"You look like \$h*t" she said.

"Thanks."

"You ready to work, or what?" Same old Leila.

"Always, but where?"

We lived in motels for months trying to get this Gym Launch thing to work.

I didn't

even have a place to live. It really did feel like starting from rock bottom.

"My dad said we could stay at his place until we figured this stuff out," she said.

I could only respond by sinking into the passenger seat of an Uber (since I had just

crashed our car).

My head hung low.

"What's up?" she asked. Trying to sound upbeat.

Everything and nothing. I felt grateful for them but disgusted with myself. Living with

my girlfriend's parents? Jesus Christ.

Has my life really come to this?

"Leila, I've got nothing. I'm a sinking ship, and I don't think you should go down

with me. I know I wouldn't."

She grabbed my chin, locked eyes with me, and said: "Alex, I would sleep with you

under a bridge if it came to that."

I would have cried tears of joy, but exhaustion robbed me of any emotional capacity.

"Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?" she asked. "All my friends

quit their jobs to do this."

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

A matter of fact, but it still stung.

And beyond the personal disasters, I was also stuck in a rough business spot.

Payment

processors held about a hundred thousand dollars hostage. See, two gyms I launched

broke their agreements.

They organized mass refunds from customers - I got for them-s

they could take my cut.

To salt the wound, I had to pay the sales guys commissions for

things left:

those sales out of my own pocket.

I I was worse than flat broke. I only had two

A \$100,000 limit on a business credit card from when I had my commercial gyms, and an

offer to gamble it on.

I was desperate.

"Listen," I said. "This could all go horribly wrong."

"I trust you," she replied. "Let's get to work. We'll figure it out."

We had six new gyms to launch... at the same time.

And remember, my last dollar

went to my sales guys.

So between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, food and ads (for all six

gyms at once), it would take \$3,300 per day of money I didn't have.

My hand was shaking

as the advertisements went live.

It's done.

And just like that, I was going into debt at a rate of \$412 dollars per working hour.

Day one: -\$3,300... I now have officially less than nothing.

Day two: -\$6,600... I have \$6,600 less than nothing.

Day three: Now \$10,000 in the hole. This decision is ruining what's left of my life.

Things were not going well. The ads worked, but people weren't buying. I hopped

onto the sales huddle to investigate.

"Alright everyone, give me your numbers!" I barked.

"2 for 14..."

"3 for 11..."

"2 for 8..."

"3 for 7..."

"0 for 7..."

"4 for 10."

"How could this get worse?!" Mark... you're 0 for 18 dude. How is that even possible?"

Silence.

I was scared. This isn't gonna work..

START HERE

One of them finally spoke up. "I had a couple of ladies say they needed to talk to their

husbands."

Another said, "I had a few of those, too. A bunch also said they needed to think

about it."

Then another, "Yea... and a lot of people think it's too expen-" I cut him off.

"Holy \$h*t you guys can't handle these? What are you, cashiers?" I was seething.

"For this to work, you actually have to sell!" I looked off to the side to hide my anger.

I

failed. Take a deep breath. I exhaled and continued, "Look if someone stalls, just ask for

their main concern and work with it. If someone wants to ask a decision maker, rely on

past times the decision maker supported them. If someone has a price objection... Look

if we were selling Ferraris at this price, people would be clawing over each other to give us

money. You gotta explain the value. You gotta connect life now to what it could be after

they buy."

A timid hand went up...

"Yeah, what?" I spat.

His voice cracked in fear. "Can, uh, you teach us this stuff?"

None objected-all looking to me for an answer.

Blood rushed from my face. His question hit me like a bus. The sales guys weren't

lazy. They weren't dumb.

They weren't unmotivated... They didn't know how to sell.

"Alright boys, this is on me. I should've prepared you better. Let's spend the rest of

this huddle going over objections."

They agreed.

"Also, I'll make us a playbook before the next huddle. We'll drill it every day and

you'll become pros in no time, deal?"

They looked excited to work. It felt good. I almost forgot my life was in ruins.

Leila walked in. "How we doin?"

"Awful, they're tanking everything."

"Uhh...why do you look so pleased about it?"

"Because I've finally run into a problem I can fix. The ads work fine. But, I learned

something big today."

"What?" She asked.

"These guys want to sell, they were just never

taught how."

"Oh. Uh, yeah. That kinda sucks. So what's the plan?"

"I'm putting a playbook together for them to drill every day. It's got all the stuff to

close the sale. All in one master doc. There's no way they won't close now."

"Alright. Just remember you've closed this sale more times than they've even had sales

appointments... combined. It'll probably take them longer to get good at this than you

want, but they're good guys. They'll pick it up fast."

"Well, what I want doesn't matter. We. All of us. Have 27 days to pull off a miracle."

"Give 'em a chance. I know these guys. They'll make it work."

I didn't even review the numbers in the next huddle. I already knew they sucked.

I didn't have to embarrass them again. So instead, we went over their most common

obstacle the stall.

Next day, same thing. Day after, same thing.

Sales started to tick up. They were handling stalls, but now they struggled the most

with price.

So, we drilled the price for a few days. Lo and behold, sales ticked up again.

Finally, we started to go from red to black. By month's end we made up for the early

weeks and broke even.

I tell you what. Never in my life have I ever felt so relieved to not

make a single dollar.

And as I kept training the team, they kept getting better.

Check out my old processing records from that month (January 2017).

You can see

the month along the left column and the revenue collected along the right.

(Dữ liệu bảng)

Gym Launch wouldn't have become the very large company it is today without

training my team to overcome sales objections.

And my life, well, I think you have an

idea of what would have happened to me if this sales training didn't work...

It's good to let people know about the stuff you sell. But, it only matters if people buy

it.

So, even more than advertising, I owe the life I have today to closing the sale.

Knowing

how to close has been the difference between success and massive failure.

And despite how

much money this skill makes... it doesn't take long to learn.

Sales teams routinely double close rates with effective closing. I can hardly think of a

better use of time.

How else can you reliably double the close rates of an entire team?

Closing is important.

And this playbook shows you exactly how I do it.

Why Is Closing So Important?

Advertising means letting people know about the stuff you sell.

Once a person shows

interest in the thing you advertise, selling begins.

Closing, the most important part of

selling, starts after you've asked the prospect to buy.

This means if you don't close, you

don't make money. Making money is important, duh.

But there's way more to the story.

Let me make an analogy to drive this point home.

If you look at the greatest athletes of all time, they score the points that matter:

In American Football, the top five red zone offenses make the playoffs 90% of the

time.

When they get close to the end zone... they close.

putting range.

Closest to the hole... and they close.

won 54% of his sets

Roger Federer, one of the greatest tennis players of all time, only

but won 80% of his matches.

How? Because he won the points that mattered. He scored the

points that would make him a winner.

He knew how to close.

When you get to the part of the sale where you ask for money, it puts the entire deal

on the line.

You make the finish line visible to you and the prospect.

Now the question

becomes... do you trip before you get there? In short, champions close.

When people do the selling, knowing how to close separates the winners from the

losers.

And learning how to close-and later-teach others to close, brings in more

revenue and scales businesses faster than any other method.

Yes, advertising scales businesses. But you can only run more ads to more people if

you make more money to pay for it.

That money comes from closing. And unless you get

good at closing, you will lose all the prospects on the fence.

Advertising Splits Your Audience Into Three Buckets:

No

UNQUALIFIED

GOAL: FILTER OUT ASAP

AREN'T SURE YET

MAYBE

GOAL: THIS IS WHY WE TRAIN!

YES

READY TO Buy

GOAL: DONT MESS IT UP

First, you have your YESes. Aka - Lay downs - Lay downs buy your thing no matter

what.

Your thing has such a high value to them, they will go out of their way to buy. The

6

**PAGE 10**

START HERE

advertising itself closed the prospect. You just have to show up to accept payment.

Most

businesses only get customers from this bucket. You have to try and mess up that sale.

And trust me, some businesses do.

Second, you have your NOs. Aka - Unqualified - Unqualified people are a bad fit

for the product.

Like people in Ohio who opt in to a gym offer in Florida.

This tends to

happen from confusion about what you sell, results you promise, and how they happen.

In short, the advertising pulled in the wrong person.

Third, and most importantly, you have your MAYBEs. Aka - On the fence - People on

the fence value what you sell but have reservations about exchanging money for it.

They

might buy your thing... and might not. Most people interested in what you sell fall into

this bucket.

These are the people we train for. And the job of the salesman is to check

those boxes, close the deal, and finish the job that advertising started.

Closing separates winners from losers because it determines who gets the massive

number of customers from bucket three.

Aka - the people who might say yes... if only

somebody closed them.

And don't believe any mythology about certain prices or buyers who "would never"

buy something without a salesperson.

People buy cars online with their credit cards now.

People have bought and sold property for millions on the internet.

It's not impossible, it's

just a smaller pool.

After all, you absolutely can advertise well enough to get someone to buy.

It's just that

if you do that successfully, you typically have a large group of other people you could also

convince to buy by explaining away their concerns and nudging them over the finish line.

This means the better your advertising, the more maybes you get. And, better ads reach

more people.

So better ads make the pie bigger, and closing gets you a bigger slice of it.

This is the opportunity.

Power: The Missing Ingredient In Most Buying Decisions

The money is in the maybes.

People on the fence struggle over a buying decision. If you think about it, they have

too little power to influence their own decision one way or another-so they waffle.

For

that reason, people on the fence avoid deciding altogether.

They think "maybe yes" and

"maybe no" which means neither yes or no.

This decision avoidance becomes the sole

focus of closing.

Decision avoidance leads to profit-destroying confusion among business owners. Let

me explain. See, a purchase describes a black-and-white event.

People either buy or not.

Right? Wrong. I understand "No" and "I avoid deciding" look the same because neither

leads to a purchase.

But look to your own experiences as a consumer. Sometimes you feel

sure about your "no".

Other times you're not so sure. In one situation you knew you didn't

want the product.

In the other situation you had trouble deciding... so you avoided the

decision.

Remember, advertising splits an audience into three major buckets, not two.

People who will buy, people who won't buy, and people who might buy.

This means some

of the people who might buy, don't.

And those people almost always get swept into the

"no" bucket.

This horrendous mistake costs businesses so much money it makes me sick.

You eliminate this profit-destroying problem by answering one question: How can

you tell the difference between somebody who doesn't want your thing and somebody who

avoids deciding?

Closing. The answer is closing. Remember-people who struggle with a decision lack

decision-making power.

Closing gives people the power to decide. The goal of closing isn't

to get the prospect to buy.

Closing gives the prospect enough power to overcome decision

avoidance. To make a decision one way or the other.

And you should feel OK about yeses

and nos. Look at it this way.

If you close properly then-best case, they buy your thing

and live happily ever after. Worst case, they don't.

But you dodge the cancerous and costly

bullet of unqualified purchases.

So, giving somebody real decision-making power means

you win either way. And I mean that.

But, you should feel bad about letting anyone stay

on the avoidance treadmill.

If you let that happen, you let them down. Everyone's time is

wasted, nobody benefits, and the prospect is worse off.

For that reason, you must give

people the power to decide.

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

Closing somebody, or giving them decision-making power, means doing three things.

First, you have to get a good understanding of what they want in the earlier

part of the sales conversation.

Second, you put what they want next to the options they have to get there.

And third, you make sure they come to a genuine decision.

Bottom line: People with enough power can decide. And if you've given someone all

the right stuff to make a decision, you've won.

Seeing sales this way changes the stakes.

Purchase or not, you have the mission to get a genuine decision.

People on the fence tend

to know your thing benefits them in some way.

For that reason, providing those people

with decision-making power will lead to more purchases overall.

Author Note: Ethical Assumptions

This objection-handling handbook is incredibly powerful. Using it, you can

get just about anyone to do just about anything.

So, the assumption moving

forward is that:

• The product will get them to their goal the way they want to go.

• You, and others will support them.

• It will work for them, not just everyone else.

Reminder: The difference between help and manipulation is intention.

**PAGE 13**

Blame: What Robs People Of Their Power

If a person avoids a decision because they don't have decision-making power... where

does the power go?

Follow the finger of blame. People avoid making decisions they could

make (about purchases or otherwise) by blaming stuff that looks reasonable but, when you

take a closer look, it doesn't make much sense.

You know full well that when people avoid

tough decisions, they blame all sorts of goofy stuff.

Tough purchasing decisions are no

exception. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to explain this.

If it's helped them avoid a

tough decision in the past, they will continue doing it in the present.

So addressing these

decision-avoidance falsehoods allows people to make a genuine decision for themselves.

Like we already know, people blame a million and one things on their avoidance.

But in my experience you can put pretty much everything into three categories. Seek

to understand, not memorize this.

If you do, you can have effective closing conversations

about almost anything.

ONION OF BLAME

EXTERNAL

CIRCUMSTANCES

OTHER PEOPLE

SELF

INTERNAL

The reason I visualize the onion of blame this way is to teach salespeople to prepare for

people to say no more than once.

They did nothing wrong. It's expected. People often have more

than one thing they blame.

And, we need to patiently give them the information to return their

power to them.

Be prepared for people to swap objections. And when that happens, it means

you're closing correctly.

Just keep peeling back the layers until you've empowered the prospect to

make a decision.

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

1) Circumstances: "I must get what I want when I want it. I must not get what I

don't want. Or else... XYZ circumstance is to blame."

2) Other People: "I must get treated fairly and kindly. Or else... XYZ person is to

blame."

3) Self: "I must be perfect, I must do well, I must get what I want, or else my XYZ

character trait is to blame."

If we know what people blame for their bad experiences, we know why they avoid

decisions about them.

And by (carefully) pointing that stuff out, we can return their

decision-making power.

It should also give you some peace of mind knowing it's totally

normal for someone to present three or four "reasons" why they can't do something before

buying.

So we prepare for that.

Once you have eliminated the reasons they cannot decide, you're now talking to

someone in power who can.

And that's the goal.

What Blame Looks Like During A Sale

In sales, we call the power-stealing stuff people blame "obstacles" or "objections".

And let's be real, no one says "I'm suffering from a distorted reality, please educate

me".

Instead they say something like "I don't have time right now" or "I need to think

about it" or "That's too expensive".

So let me lay out the common objections in a more

familiar way:

WHAT IT IS

CIRCUMSTANCES

OTHER PEOPLE

SELF

HOW IT PRESENTS

"I'M TOO Busy"

→"IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE"

"I NEED TO TALK TO MY X"

"I'VE BEEN BURNED BEFORE

"IT'S NOT FOR ME"

BLAME: WHAT ROBS PEOPLE OF THEIR POWER

1) Circumstances: Buying this prevents me from doing other stuff I'd rather do.

Buying this prevents me from buying other stuff I'd rather buy.

I will avoid buying

this stuff because I will claim other stuff outside of my control (that isn't) prevents

me from doing so.

a) Time: "I don't have time for this right now" or "I'm too busy"

b) Money: "This is too expensive" or "I can't afford it"

c) Fit: "I don't like this detail about the product/service" or "Not right for me" or

"I need something different than what you offer"

2) Other People: Someone else doesn't trust me enough to make purchases on my

own, or I don't trust you enough to buy from you.

a) Authority/Permission: "I need to check with X before deciding." (My

partner doesn't trust me to buy stuff)

b) Trust/Skepticism: "I've been burned before" or "Let me think about it" or

"What makes you different?"

(I don't trust you enough to buy stuff)

3) Self:

a)

Fear: "It might work for them, but it won't work for me" or "I'm scared to

repeat my past mistakes"

b) Avoidance: "I need to think about it" or "Send me a brochure and I'll email

you tomorrow"

With that being said, let's get to it. I'll provide the words and a visual for each so that

if you give this to your team, you can reference it.

"So Much Stuff, I'm Overwhelmed!" → Use what feels right to you.

I want to make a few things clear. Closing is about understanding how blame robs

people of their decision-making power.

So once this all clicks, and it will, you'll be able to

say this stuff in your own words, on the fly, in no time.

I've closed many thousands of times, and I've only put closes in here that I've used

with success.

I know I give more, but you only need one or two ways to respond to each

obstacle.

The point is to get good at closing, not become an encyclopedia of closes.

So

commit to learning the ones you like and you'll do just fine.

But you must really commit

to learning them.

My Rules of Closing

RULES

I designed this guide explicitly for "after the prospect says no".

As I alluded to in the

beginning, the better you are at marketing, the more concerns have been resolved ahead

of time.

The worse your marketing, the more thorough your sales team and process need

to be.

It needs to be used in this way. That being said, I have a few things I'd like to pass

on as you start this journey...

1) When in doubt, repeat back what they said. When you repeat back what they

said, you get some time to think about what you're gonna say next - and - you get

some active listening bonus skills.

Now, I'm not saying be a parrot, but the reality

is-too few salesmen listen at all, so this is good practice in general for most.

2) Acknowledge or agree, but never disagree. The moment you disagree, it increases

the likelihood people become hostile. Avoid.

Instead, buy yourself time by doing

two things: 1) repeat back the last thing they just said. Nod your head.

Then say

either something like "totally agree" or "totally understand" or "that's a great point"

or "thank you for bringing that up" or "You're totally right, I forgot to mention..."

as ways to transition into your closes.

We want our closes and responses to be

reframes or other ways to think about it but never a disagreement.

3) Before getting real, get permission. If you need to "get real" with someone, ask

them for permission first.

Here are my two favorite ways: 1) "Can I be a coach

instead of a friend for a second?"

2) "Would it be totally overstepping for me to

put my coach hat on for a second?"

3) "Can I tell you what I told someone in your

exact position just yesterday that helped her make this decision?"

Then deliver the

harsh truth.

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

4) Learn to stack closes. If one close works well, often a second works even better.

You can stack multiple closes together. Sometimes they don't bite at the first one,

so you hit it from another angle or another analogy.

And once it gets through, it

will take us one step closer to a sale.

5) You don't need to memorize. You need to understand.

When you understand

the logic behind the closes, you can use them in your own words to help people

decide.

Understanding the reasoning behind them will allow you to move between

them smoothly.

6) You only need two or three closes per obstacle. I provide a ton of closes.

But,

you don't need to use them all... not even close.

You just need to know two or three

per main obstacle that you like.

7) Use nudges when someone ne is right on the edge.

They're woven into a lot of the

closes in here.

8) Yellows are golds. Be a trashman. Practice on unqualified leads. The more you

close the better you get.

So you want to get as many reps as possible. I train my

teams to be equal opportunity closers.

As long as the person has the problem to

solve, we try to close.

This may seem in contrast to STAR (Situation, Task, Action,

Result). But, I don't think so.

Mainly because, 1) people lie 2) you already have

the time blocked for the consult 3) you might as well practice closing.

This gets

you better faster. And less qualified prospects give you a bigger challenge than

laydowns.

So I see this as the perfect opportunity for practice. And you might

just make some money too.

9) Volume negates luck. The best way to guarantee that you'll be world class is to do

so many sales that it would be unreasonable that you aren't.

10) Don't assume objections mean they won't buy. More times than you might

think.

Statements like "It's expensive" aren't actual objections. Sometimes they're

just observations. To which you can respond, "I agree."

Or, just let them process

out loud. Unless they say they don't wanna buy, don't assume it.

Sometimes people

just process their thoughts out loud. You're just there for the show.

11) Never change your price on the spot to get a sale.

Assuming your product

provides the value then changing the price just to get a sale sends you down a sad,

dark, and ethically questionable path.

Nevermind getting bullied by your own

customers! Avoid.

12) If you feel like you're always in a battle, look at what happens before they

show up to the call and at your scripting before you ask for the sale.

**PAGE 18**

MY RULES OF CLOSING

13) Only ask for the sale when you think you've got 'em.

If you think they need

more convincing, keep probing.

14) People want to believe you. They want to buy.

You must help their brains justify

the decision they already want to make.

15) Selling happens before you ask for the sale. Closing happens after.

16) It's easier to handle problems before you ask for money than after.

Diffuse as

much as you can before the ask.

17) Expect and plan for no. It's not failure; it's expected.

18) Price shock isn't a "no." Unless someone tells you there's a problem, assume

they're just processing their thoughts out loud.

19) Selling properly is the first step to becoming a coach.

If you want to help

people, you need to learn to help them make decisions to help themselves.

And

that's exactly what a helpful coach does.

20) The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale.

Keep the

prospect, not the sale, as the priority. If you keep their long-term well being at the

center of the conversation, you will approach things with the right frame.

They

will hear it in your tone. It also completely divorces you from needing to make

a sale.

This pays dividends long term. Sometimes the best sales we make are the

ones we don't.

21) Seek to understand, not to argue. This diffuses any tough situations.

Just try and

understand their perspective rather than get them to agree. Ask questions, don't

accuse.

22) Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.

You can only build

trust if you genuinely want to help.

You build trust by doing tips 11, 12, 13. They

create an environment that increases the likelihood of a sale occurring.

And -

23) Belief and trust are a continuum, not binaries. You can always get better at

getting people to believe and trust you.

So the question isn't whether they believe

you or not, it's how much they believe you.

24) Closers ask hard questions because they genuinely care. You wanna be kind,

not nice.

Nice guys don't want to offend. Kind people want to genuinely help the

person improve their lives.

And sometimes that means calling them on their BS...

in a tactful way by helping them realize it for themselves.

25) If you're going to say something offensive, don't say it about them, say it about

someone like them or your past self.

If you say "you definitely have time for this

program, show me your phone, I'll show you how much time you waste" you may

be right but you wont close the sale.

So, like the phone usage overcome, you tell

a story of yourself saying the same thing or of you having this conversation with

someone else.

It still has the same effect, it's just easier on the ego. They'll connect

the dots.

26) Once the prospect says yes, shut up. Don't sell yourself out of a sale.

This is the

rule of law. Everything else you say has the potential to disrupt what's working.

27) Record all your sales to learn from them. There's a reason champions watch

game tape.

And champion sales people treat each sale like a performance. See

what you did well. What you could improve.

Focus on improving one thing at

a time until you've corrected the things you suck at so much that you're actually

good.

28) Power is the ability to direct or influence people.

If you want to be powerful,

you must understand how to close.

Keep practicing. Don't give up. Commit a few to memory. Try them. Watch them

work. Try a few more.

And in no time you'll be one of the top closers on the team. Just

remember this is a skill.

And if it's a skill you can learn it.

With that being said, let's dive in. Although I outlined different places where people

cast their blame, there are some overcomes that work *no matter what*.

If there's a section

of this handbook to commit to memory it would be this one. These have made me.

So.

Much. Money.

Use responsibly.

All-Purpose Closes

CLICK!

These are the 80/20 closes. These are the 20% of closes that work 80% of the time.

After this section, we'll go into specific closes for each source of blame.

They work well

if people bring the same obstacle back up.

But these puppies cut through a lot of smoke

and mirrors and force prospects to wake up and decide.

Or, pick a real obstacle you can

then overcome.

You can use these to respond to any objection that's *not yes*.

They say: *ANYTHING THAT'S NOT YES*

The "What's Your Main Concern" Close

You say: What's your main concern? What are you afraid of happening?

This is probably my most used phrase to build rapport with a prospect.

If someone

says they need to think about it, ask what their main concerns are or what variables they

are using to make the decision.

This allows you to have a more productive conversation. If

they give you fluff answers, use the more pointed version, what are you afraid of happening?

If they still don't budge, spell out the actual worst case... so you're afraid of spending money

and me stealing it and spending it in Vegas?

They'll laugh and say no, then you're back in

the sale and they'll give you a closer answer to the truth.

The "Reason" Close

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

You say: The reason you are telling yourself not to do this is the reason you should

do it.

Examples:

MONEY: How long do you want "I can't afford this" to be on your list of problems

in life?

The fact that you don't have money is the very reason you need to do this more

than anyone.

TIME: The fact that you don't have time is the very reason you need to do this.

AUTHORITY: The fact that you're so dependent on your spouse is the reason you

need to take this decision and own it.

AVOIDANCE: The fact that you're not sure about the person that you want to be is

the very reason that we're going to help you get in this program.

Whatever the reason is, usually the biggest chain that you're holding on to is the thing

that you're enslaving yourself to, is the thing that you're casting your power to.

If you

break that chain, power comes back to you.

The very reason that you're holding yourself

back is typically the very reason that you need to do it.

The "Hypothetical" Close

You say: If this were perfect, would you do it? Then what's the difference between

perfect and what we've got?

If they say some actual small detail, fix it and close.

If they can't think of anything because

they're not going to know all the things you can deliver on the spot....

You say: Right, well because it sounds like it's nothing to do with the program; it's

something else.

What are you afraid of happening? Let's talk about that.

This works astonishingly well.

The "Zoom Out" Close

You say: Let's zoom out for a second. You want [X]. We sell [X].

Do you think

overanalyzing the details might be the reason you haven't made it happen yet?

At the end

of the day, you just need to decide whether you think this makes it more likely for you to

hit your goal than doing this on your own.

And if you've tried that already, then maybe

this is just the thing you've been waiting for it just doesn't look like you expected it to.

The "1 to 10" Close

ALL-PURPOSE CLOSES

You say: On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you're not interested at all and 10

means you're ready to start right now, where do you see yourself?

If they say 10...

You say: "Great. Let's rock and roll." And close the sale.

If they say 9 or less...

You say: "What would it take to get you to a 10?"

They reply.

You say: "No big deal. I think we can take care of that for you. Feeling 10ish now?"

The "Best Case Worst Case" Close

Here are three variations.

1) You say: Let's consider the options, both are risk-free, only one is guaranteed to

not get you what you want.

Best case-worst case. Option one, you do the thing, you get

the result, life is awesome.

Option two, you don't do the thing, you don't get the result

because you didn't do the thing.

Option three, you do the thing, but then you don't get the

result.

These are the options that can happen in front of you because we have a guarantee,

they're all risk-free except for one of them.

Only one of them has a true guarantee of not

getting you where you want, which is walking out the door.

So, which risk-free option do

you want, the one that's risk-free that guarantees that you're not going to get there or the

one that's risk-free and has the potential to get you where you want to go?

2) You say: Best case we change your life forever.

Worst case you get X amount of

time free and learn a bunch of stuff along the way.

Either way you get closer to your goal.

Ready to start?

3) You say (No guarantee alternate): Let's consider the options. Option one, you

take a risk and do this.

You either hit the goal or you get closer to your goal no matter

what because you'll learn a ton.

Option two, you take no risk but you guarantee you

don't get what you want by not starting.

So, which option do you feel gets you closer

to your goal?

I didn't know where to put this. But sometimes people claim they don't have a

But, it can

payment method on

to put it

in the all-purpose closing chapter.

You can avoid them by following this process. Once I get verbal agreement, I first ask

for their ID.

This forces them to take their wallet out. Once they give their ID to me, I use

it to fill out the contract for them.

You can make easy chit chat about their picture and

where they're from etc. This fills the time.

Once you've copied their information down,

then I gesture to their wallet they usually have open on the table in front of me and say...

"I'll trade you for the card you wanna use."

I motion with the ID between my two fingers

towards their wallet.

(If you're remote you would just ask them to bring their ID to the screen).

After they take out their ID, typically their other cards are in plain sight.

This avoids

many of the "forgot my wallet" or "forgot my card" things people pull at the last minute.

Also writing down their card number ensures they don't accidentally write the wrong

number.

So you avoid multiple issues all at once.

If for some reason, they still say it, then you can use the overcome below.

These sound like...

"I forgot my wallet at home"

"I don't have the card I want to use on me"

The "Card Not On Me" Close

You say: No problem. Do you have your phone on you? Great.

Just pull up your

banking app, go to statements, and you can find the account number on the top right.

I'll

Google the routing number while you do that.

Author Note: ACH

If you don't currently take automated clearing house (ACH) payments, you

should.

Besides the lower costs, fewer expirations and account changes, and

decreased risk of chargebacks, you can always sign up a new client, even if

they don't have their wallet.

We used to save a ton of sales with this. Very

useful.

ALL-PURPOSE CLOSES

By the end of this, you have a person who is in complete power and has the ability to

make a decision for themselves.

We've wiped out any concerns for circumstances. We've

circumvented as many decision-maker roadblocks getting in the way of their decision.

We've demolished any reason they have for not making a decision now, today.

Now you

can finally get this person to decide.

If for some reason they bring up another source of blame again, we can isolate it and

close them.

Let's start with some of the most common sources of blame-circumstances.

What I Say When They Blame Circumstances

BLAME THAT!

Core Argument: "I avoid buying your thing because of stuff out of my control."

What To Do About It: We help them understand how they choose to let circumstances

decide for them.

But that's good news, because it also means they have the power to

change it.

This shifts decision-making power from the circumstances back to them.

***

Saying "I can't make the wedding because (something outside of my control) came

up" absolves the person of responsibility.

They can avoid saying no and get away with it

by blaming other stuff.

Our goal is to get them to say "I'm not going to your wedding

because I'm choosing to do something more valuable to me."

You want the prospect to

understand there is absolutely nothing wrong with making genuine decisions in their best

interest.

Let's look at common ways people avoid buying decisions by blaming their

circumstances and some of my favorite ways to address it:

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

REPEATED FOR EMPHASIS: Assume all replies have "totally

understand" before the close.

Assume you say something like "Totally get it," "Heard," "That's a great

point," or "I'm right there with you" before you transition to the overcome.

Reminder: You sit on the same side of the table. You're not competing

with them.

Validate what they say before responding to it. You can never

convince someone.

We can only guide them through a series of questions and

statements to convince themselves.

What I Say When They Blame Time

BLAME THAT!

Blaming Time. People get busy. Then they get unbusy. Then they get busy again. Life

works that way.

But here's the thing-people make time for stuff either way.

So if anyone

points their finger at "time," we have two things to address.

What To Do About It: First, we help them see where their hours go.

Second, we

discuss how they can better use them.

If our thing saves them time compared to what they do now.

If our thing makes their

life easier than they have it now.

And if we support them so they get maximum value

from it.

Then, compared to the other stuff, our thing really does make for a better use of

their time. Win-win.

And since we're there to help, starting while busy is actually the best

time to start.

It means they'll get even more value when they're not!

WHAT SAY WHEN THEY BLAME CIRCUMSTANCES

When people say they don't have the time, these sound like...

. "I'm too busy right now"

. "I don't have the time"

"Better To Start When You're Busy"

You say: Totally understand. Honestly, here's some good news: the busier you are, the

better time it is to start.

Because life is always going to have busy seasons, and if you can't

figure out how to do it during busy seasons, then this isn't going to last.

And you want

this to last, right? Then what better time to do it than when you need it most?

"You're Gonna Get Busy Again"

You say: Totally understand. Even if you did wait until it wasn't busy, you'd get busy

again right?

Well, then even if you did start when you had time, you'd stop again the

moment you were busy.

So, if you learn how to make this work when you're busy, then

you'll be able to stick with it no matter what life throws at you.

And you want this to be

permanent right? Right...

(Nudge over the edge) And besides, this is geared to give you time back, not cost you

time.

The first thing we're gonna do is get you to stop doing all the stuff that isn't working.

"It's Not About Timing, It's About Priorities"

You say: Totally understand it's a busy time right now. Can I ask you a real question?

What are you doing that's more important than this right now?

okay, well, either

you're never going to have time, or something needs to become less important so this

can be more important.

It sounds like it's more a question of priorities than it is timing.

Because let's face it, stuff is always going to come up.

So either [goal] is more important

than these interruptions, or it's not. And if it's not, that's totally okay.

I'd rather you leave

knowing you're never going to achieve [goal] rather than suffering all the time hoping it's

going to happen.

It's either important enough to change your schedule for, or it's not.

And if it is, then let's do it.

"The Smartphone Close"

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

You say: Totally understand. I honestly thought the same thing when I started my

business.

And I told that to my wife. And instead of saying "sure baby, do it later" she had

had enough of my whining and said "give me your phone" so I did, and she pulled out

my time usage and it showed 20 hours per week on social media.

She said "I guess I found

you some time," and handed it back to me.

Because at the end of the day, you me and Jeff Bezos all had the same 24 hours when

we started out, it's all about how we allocate them.

And up to this point, would you say

you've allocated your time well to get to where you want?

If not, then that's exactly what

we're going to show you how to do.

An extra nudge: And the first thing we're going to do is actually eliminate 90% of the

stuff you're doing that's not working to make room for what does.

Author Note: What's a nudge?

I don't think they count as full overcomes, but they are one-liners that I've

tipped deals over the edge with.

They work especially well when you can see

someone is right on the edge of making a decision.

When people say they don't have the time, it sounds like...

• "I'll start when I have the time"

The "When/Then" Close

You say: Totally understand. This is a classic example of a when/then issue.

I used to

do this all the time. Can I explain why this thought kept me stuck for almost a decade?

Well, it's a false premise. When you say "I'll do it when I have more time" it's like saying

"When I get healthy, then I'll go to the doctor" or "When I'm rich, then I'll start saving

money."

It flips the order.

WHAT I SAY WHEN THEY BLAME CIRCUMSTANCES

What I Say When They Blame Money

00 \$\$\$

Blaming money. Using money to avoid purchasing decisions comes in four flavors:

1) Not enough value. They point their blame finger at the price.

Here, they have the

money but avoid buying because they don't see the value.

2) I can't afford it. In the next (far rarer) situation, they see the value, but it really

does cost more than they've got.

3) Other people do it for less. In the next, they point to other people who they

claim offer a similar product for less.

4) I'd buy it for less. And finally, you have people who haggle and ask for discounts.

We'll cover how to overcome all four.

Author Note: Qualifying Prospects STAR

Use common sense. Qualify prospects before selling them. Trying to sell

somebody a product well beyond their means wastes everyone's time.

You

simply sell an unqualified prospect. And unqualified prospects are not a sales

problem-they're an advertising problem.

To qualify a prospect, you make

sure they have S-T-A-R.

In other words, the problem to solve (Situation),

the time to solve it (Timing), the authority to decide (Authority), and the

money to spend (Resources).

This is a STAR prospect. But, prospects fib and

change their answers, so that's why we train closing.

**PAGE 30**

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

What To Do About It: If something really did have value then, so long as you have

a qualified prospect, they would figure out how to get it.

Remember, nothing is inherently

"too expensive". If somebody says "the price is too high" they aren't saying they don't value

your thing.

But, they are saying they'll avoid deciding until they see the value of your

product meet or exceed the value of their dollar.

For that reason, you should immediately

translate "price too high" into "value too low".

You want to shift the focus away from the price they pay and toward the value they

get.

And you do this by putting all the painful stuff they have to deal with now next to all

the awesome stuff that replaces it after they buy.

Next, we'll address otherwise qualified customers objecting to the price because it really

does sit just beyond their current means.

We do this by appealing to their resourcefulness-

and how having goals just beyond reach actually gives them an advantage.

For the "guy down the street does it for less" folks, we ask them why they didn't buy

from them already.

Typically there is a difference in delivery-which we highlight-to

explain our price (and value) difference.

And finally, when someone asks to pay less for the same thing, we offer to charge

more.

This puts an end to the haggling and forces them to make a decision.

When people say your thing doesn't have enough value, these sound like...

"It's too much" → Not Enough Value

"It's Good That It's A Lot"

You say: I understand that it feels like a lot of money, and that's actually why I believe

this is the right step for you.

Most of our biggest success stories started exactly where you

are-seeing this as a big investment.

And honestly, that's a good thing. The fact that this feels like a big investment means

you're more likely to take it seriously.

Just imagine: if you follow all the steps I outlined,

do you have any doubt you'd succeed? Of course not.

The commitment of your hard-

earned money is there to hold you accountable.

If this were just \$1, it might be easy to

overlook, just like other things you've tried in the past.

And let's think about the worst-case scenario. You mentioned losing \$XXX feels

significant.

That tells me you wouldn't take this lightly. The real risk isn't in investing the

WHAT I SAY WHEN THEY BLAME CIRCUMSTANCES

money; it's walking out the door right now and staying where you are, without achieving

the results you want.

Remember, real transformations happen when we decide to go all in-when we

"burn the boats" and commit fully.

It's those who barely blink at the price who aren't

as successful because it's not a real investment for them.

But for you, this investment is

meaningful, and that's why I'm confident in saying: You ARE going to succeed.

(Nudge) If this means a lot to you, I know you will succeed.

So, are you ready

"Good Things Aren't Cheap-Cheap Things Aren't Good"

to take

the next step and get started?

You say: Totally understand. Let me ask you a question.

How many free pdfs have

you downloaded and made no more money?

We had two choices: give the bare minimum

for people to be successful and control costs to make it as easy as possible on your part,

OR, we could rather than starting with price, start with value, and put so much help,

support, and resources to stack the chips in your favor so much it would be unreasonable

not to be successful.

So yes, it's not cheap, but would you rather be less likely to hit your

goal? Right-us neither.

"Would You Even Believe Me If It Were Less?"

You say: Totally hear where you're coming from. Let me ask you a question... Would

you even believe it could do what I say it could do if it were one third the price?

(They'll say no)... Then what are we talking about?? (joking tone) Let's get you going.

"It's Not A Lot When You Think About It"

You say: Totally understand. Let me ask you a question... Hypothetically, if this got

you an extra \$10,000/mo would it be worth it?

If so, then it's not the price, it's whether

you believe you can do it, right?

Well, if I show you success stories of people like you, at

what point does it become more unreasonable to believe?

10, 20, 50? Okay, well here's

200. At some point you just have to make the jump.

If this only XXX, would it be worth it?

If all it does is XXX, would it be worth it?

Right, then the only thing more expensive would be not doing it.

"Not What You Make But What It's Worth"

You say: Totally understand. But I think it's not about how much you make today. It's

about how much you're gonna make and how much that's worth to you. Right?

"You're Gonna Spend The Money Either Way"

You say: Totally understand. And let's be honest, in the next 12 months, you're

gonna spend this amount of money either way.

So the money is already spent. All we're

doing is deciding where it's going.

Are you gonna spend it on stuff that doesn't matter,

or on something that 12 months from now you can look back and say "that was the best

decision of my life?"

After all, what is money good for anyways? It only has value when it is exchanged.

Your goal is to exchange it for something better than doing nothing with it, or spending

it on something else.

But what better to spend money on than the skill to increase your

ability to generate money and do work you find meaningful?

"You Pay The Price Either Way"

You say: Totally understand. Mind if I share a different way of thinking about it?

(they nod)... You're gonna pay the price either way. With years of your own life to figure

it out, or with a payment today to use the time other people have already put in for you.

We just pay with the currency we value least. Your time or your money.

As long as you value your time above minimum wage, you come out way ahead

buying your time back at a steep discount and dragging your future earning power into

the present.

(Nudge) And at the end of the day, that's why we reverse all the risk and provide you

a XX guarantee or your money back.

So best case, you accomplish everything we said, or,

worst case, you learn tons of stuff for free.

Either way, you win.

The "Some Now or More Later" Close

You say: Totally understand. If that's the case this is probably the best time to do it

then because it's only gonna become more expensive.

Doing this costs some now but not

doing this will cost more later.

The amount of time and money will only increase as you

put it off.

So let's get it done now while it's the cheapest and fastest it's gonna be.

WHAT I SAY WHEN THEY BLAME CIRCUMSTANCES

The "Future Favor" Close

You say: It totally is a lot of money, but that's because of the amount of time it will

save you.

How long have you been wanting this? As long as you can remember, right?

If

10 years ago, you could have made a decision that would have made the last 10 years of

your life the fittest and best, would that be worth what we're asking?

Of course, right?

So then let's do future you a favor and have her look back on these next 10 years really

excited about having made the decision that changed it for good.

When people say they don't have the money, these sound like...

"I can't afford it"

"It's not in my budget"

"Resourcefulness Not Resources"

You say: So you don't have the money? In other words, the resources to start, is that

right?

Can I tell you something that blew my mind when I heard it?

Do you know the difference between a self-made millionaire when they had nothing

and someone who has nothing? Nothing financially.

The only difference is that it proves

that if they were successful, it wasn't about the resources they had;

it's about how resourceful

they were.

(Optional addition if they look like they don't get it): Phil Knight, in the story of

Nike, was about to lose everything multiple times.

He needed a tremendous amount of

money and didn't have it. His people already worked for free.

He went to his vendors and

said, "You need to pay my payroll for me."

He used his resourcefulness, not his resources.

When you have nothing, it's the easiest excuse to give yourself because you're like,

"Well, I have nothing, that's why I can't."

But every self-made millionaire and every self-

made billionaire started with nothing, which puts them in the exact same seat you are.

The question is, how much control do you want over your life?

When you have power,

you focus on the things you can control how resourceful you are, not the resources

you have.

You say: Super reasonable. So let me ask you... if we were the same price, which one

would you pick?

(they say you). Why? (Then they'll list out all the reasons you're better.) You

wait until they finish then say: I totally agree!

Those are all awesome reasons. Couldn't have

said it better myself.

So now you understand why we aren't the same price, right? Then

laugh and ask for the sale again.

WHAT I SAY WHEN THEY BLAME CIRCUMSTANCES

"Good Fast Cheap"

You say: Totally get it. Have you ever heard of the value triangle? Well it's simple...

Good. Fast. Cheap.

You get to

pick two. I'm the good and fast guy. But I'm still only the

second most expensive.

Want to know the most expensive option? The most expensive

option is using the fast and cheap guy. Regretting it.

Then ending up working with

me anyway-a day late and a dollar short.

If you start with me you save the time and

money you're gonna waste with the other guy not getting what you want the first time,

done right.

"Cheap Or What You Need"

You say: I hear you. Maybe think about it this way.

At the end of the day, you have

two choices-you can buy something cheap, or what you need.

In other words, you can

get yet another thing that doesn't hurt to buy because you and I both know it won't do

anything, or you can invest in yourself and solve this problem for good.

If you look at the

value of your time and what [being in amazing shape for every picture, event, summer

with the kids, and other events in your life,] don't you think this would be worth it?

When people haggle to try and get a lower price, these sound like...

"Can you do it for less?"

"Can you do it for \$XXX?"

The "We Could Do It For More" Close

You say: Uhh...we could do it for more (ha).

OR

You say: We could do it for \$XXX (price higher than you quoted).

Note: If someone ever asks for a discount, this works insanely well.

When people haggle to try and get a lower price, these sound like...

. "It's not the money...it's [ this other thing you can't control]"

Ex: "It's not the money, I just don't think I'd use it"

"It's Not, Not The Money"

You say: "If this were free, would you do it?" (They say yes).

So it's not, not about the money. OK, well... I tell you what.

If you're gonna do it

either way, you might as well lock in the savings now, then we can push out your start

date/ship date as far as you like.

Because if you like a discount/bonus now, you're gonna

like one later.

Note: As soon as someone says they'd do it for less, they give up all objections unrelated

to price and payment.

This allows you to focus on only one obstacle then dismantle it.

Additional Note: As soon as you say you'll do it for less, you give up all appeals to

your product's value.

This takes you from closing to haggling. Gross.

This concludes our circumstance closes. We covered time and money-in all their

flavors that people use to avoid buying.

That being said, just because we overcame

these doesn't mean they won't come up with something else to blame.

This is good. When

someone changes what they blame, we're getting close to a buyer in power.

Now, we move onto one of the hardest obstacles to overcome they don't have

permission to buy (or at least, they claim they don't).

**PAGE 37**

When They Blame Other People

BLAME THEM!

Core Argument: "I don't want to buy your thing because SOMEONE ELSE

prevents me."

What To Do About It: We need to help them understand that there are no social

obligations, only social consequences.

They don't need permission, they need support.

They are in control of their lives and as soon as they give that control away, they'll never

be able to own their lives.

***

I have only had one series of questions that has worked to close these consistently.

I'll

also note that if you are asking someone to make a life-changing decision, there's no point

in forcing it.

You'll need partner buy-in if the purchase materially affects their household.

This applies to any obstacle someone uses to deflect power to their spouse, business

partner, employees, kids, dog, whatever.

When They Blame Decision Makers

The best way to avoid this is to have decision makers on the call ahead of time.

Make

sure they can make a decision if you're gonna hop on the call (this is in the qualification

process).

We often reschedule if we know all decision makers won't be on the call.

But, if you're in a sales environment where you gotta try and close, then I'll give you

the best sequence I know of.

It's best for selling cheap stuff relative to the buying power

of the prospect.

Instead of being a couple lines, this is a series of questions and responses

with their own off ramps and destinations.

Meaning, someone can agree at any point in

this sequence.

**PAGE 38**

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

And once they agree... close the sale. These are the steps:

1) What if they say no? What if XXX doesn't give you permission?

In my

experience, one out of three times, prospects would say "I'd probably do it

anyways."

As soon as they said that, I'd say "Awesome! If you're gonna do it

either way, let's just get you started!"

But if not, I'd ask...

2) What would they object to? Get around them making the decision and ask

what the decision maker would object to.

This diverts focus back to a different

obstacle that you can overcome.

3) If they know you're not happy, why would they stop you?

Explain that

their partner is probably fine with it already.

Explain that their spouse would

surely say yes and approve of the decision.

What we are trying to bring up

are things that their spouse did already approve of to make the argument that

this is just like those, and close the gap, with the assumption that they would

approve of this if asked.

Ask for support not permission. Remind them that they are their own

person and should make the decision for themselves.

Alright, so let's dive in.

These sound like:

•

"I have to talk to my spouse/business partner/grandma/employees/dog/etc"

• "I can't make this decision alone"

You say: What if they don't give you permission? Or, what if your spouse says no?

If they say: "I'd do it anyway."

You say: Awesome. Then let's get you started.

If instead they say: "Then I wouldn't do it."

Then you say: What part specifically do you think they wouldn't approve of? The

price? The program? Or me? haha.

If they give you an answer off ramp and handle that

**PAGE 39**

WHEN THEY BLAME OTHER PEOPLE

If instead they say: "I just don't make decisions without my spouse"

You say: Does your spouse approve of your current struggle?

If they don't then why

do you think they'd be against you fixing something they already don't approve of?

(Nudge) Role reversal. If the roles were reversed and your husband needed this to

make his dreams happen, or your wife needed this program to make her dreams happen,

would you support her?

Then why wouldn't you support you?

If they still say: "My partner and I always make decisions together"

You say: Totally get it. Can I offer a potentially different perspective?

(yes)... I think

you're asking for support not permission. Because... let's play it out. It's your life, not

theirs.

What happens is if you give that power to them and then two years from now

you're [BAD THING BUT MORE], who are you going to blame?

Them. That's when

resentment sets in. And that's not fair to you or them.

I'm not saying you shouldn't explain the decision to them, you just need to ask for

their support.

If they still say no...

You say: I tell ya what... sign up, I'll delay the payment and if your partner says you

should stay poor, fat, stupid and lazy... you give me a call and - first - I'd like to talk to

them.

And - second - I'll tear up the contract. This way you lock in your spot but you still

get time to talk to your partner.

Fair enough?

Pro Tip: Three Day No-Sweat Guarantee

Most states require this anyways, so you're not changing much.

And the

downsell version is to put a card down and delay payment for 24-72 hours so

they can "lock in the spot" but still have time to chat it over.

If they still say no...

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

Go for a humorous hypothetical extreme: NAME... hear me out... if you sign up

and you tell (YOUR PARTNER'S NAME) and he's upset, and when he sees you, he's

like, 'Girl, I don't want you to get in shape.

I want you to stay overweight. I want you to

put those sweatpants on.

I want you to sit on that couch, reach your hand into a bag of

Cheetos, wipe the Cheetos fingers on your sweatpants.

And create generational unhealth.

I want you to live ten years less long.

I want you to not see our grandkids. I don't want

that.' Right?

I want to marry a younger, better you sooner because you're going to have a

heart attack.

If he says that to you, you have him call me.

*They're cracking up normally* Okay, okay, listen. Sign up. Three-day no-sweat.

If he

does tell you that he just wants you to be out of shape and never leave him because you're

going to get too hot... if he says that, just let me know and I'll tear this up no problem.

(Nudge) Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission right? (ha)

When They Blame Bad Experiences With Other Products

BLAME THEM!

People who blame others for their decision avoidance can be a pain to deal with. But,

it's totally doable.

I've learned over the years that how you deliver your message matters

as much as the message itself.

You can have the perfect script, but unless you've got big

rapport and correct tonality you will flop.

They're not the prisoners they make themselves

out to be.

So if you can get them to laugh at the silliness of blaming others, and that they

really can make decisions for themselves, you'll get a genuine close.

And luckily, we now

have some humorous ways to point it out.

WHEN THEY BLAME OTHER PEOPLE

These sound like:

. "I've been burned before..."

. "I tried something like this already and it didn't work"

"Don't Let It Burn You Twice"

You say: Totally understand your reservations. I'd feel the same way too if the same

thing had happened to me.

But maybe this is worth considering... If you don't do this,

then you let that bad decision burn you twice.

It burned you once when you made the

poor investment, but it'll burn you twice if that bad decision prevents you from making

a good one.

It would be like having a bad eighth-grade boyfriend or girlfriend and being like, you

know what, men aren't for me.

All coaches suck, right? There are good coaches and bad

coaches. There are crazy-ass chicks and crazy-ass dudes.

There are also good ones. The

only thing worse than making a bad investment is letting one bad investment stop you

from making a good one.

Don't let that bad decision burn you twice.

Other People Conclusion

Remember, in the best situation you talk to both of them at once. Or they come to

you with permission-in-hand.

But if you don't, this gives you the best tools I've got. It's

closed many sales for me.

I hope it does for you too.

Next Up...

So up to this point we've addressed:

Time. They can make better use of their time. And besides, the best time is now

because they're always going to be busy anyway.

They benefit from time saved or spent on

this anyway.

Money. We appeal to their resourcefulness. They'll spend the money anyway, they may

as well spend it on something valuable.

And when the result they want really does have a

greater value than the price it'll pay for itself.

When they see this, they'll figure out a way.

Price. Remember, "price too high" really means "value too low".

If our offer appears to

have too little value, then we do a better job at making the value real.

Authority. Catching flak from a partner for doing something that benefits them.

Seriously?

This is about realizing the support they already have. They can own their life

decisions.

Now we've got the final layer in the onion of blame, the self.

Avoiding decisions by

blaming the self comes in two basic flavors, and we'll address them both. It's closing time.

**PAGE 43**

When They Take The Blame

WHO...ME?

Core argument: "I avoid buying your thing because I'm scared of making a mistake."

They avoid. The qualified prospects' avoidance when pointing the finger at themselves

comes in two basic forms.

First, they know you can solve their problem but don't like how

your product goes about it.

This makes their own preferences about features or details of

your solution to blame.

And second, they get scared around new things, or they've tried

to solve this problem before and failed.

In either case they use their own fear getting a bad

result as a way to avoid making decisions that can actually get them results.

What To Do About It: We help them decide by explaining that a past failure should

never make them miss an opportunity for future success.

And really, the biggest mistake

of all is not making a decision.

If they avoid making a decision it guarantees they stay the

same-which is not where they wanna be!

***

You've probably come across some very common avoidance tactics, including "I need

to think about it," or "I'll call you tomorrow with my card."

How do you respond? A buncha different ways.

You can help them understand effective decision making. You can highlight the pros

and cons of waiting.

And you can learn more about their past experiences and preferences

to see if you can clear up any confusion.

But after testing 100's of things I made a huge

discovery.

You only need a few that you feel comfortable with.

So even though the responses

vary in their rhymes and reasons, just remember they all do the same thing: motivate a

decision.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

**PAGE 44**

\$100M PLAYBOOK: CLOSING

Again, people hate making decisions because they hate making mistakes.

So your

responsibility is to show them that avoiding the decision is the biggest mistake of all.

And

more, that it does the opposite of what they want.

It takes them even further from where

they wanna go. Let's close 'em.

We'll attack two flavors of self-blame:

1) When they blame their own preferences. I'm scared of new things, I'll stick with

what I know even if it fails.

I messed this up before, therefore I'll mess it up again.

2) When they blame rushed decisions. I don't know how to make a decision.

When They Blame Their Own Preferences

I DON'T LIKE ١٢

Blaming Preferences. "I want your results, but I I need to get them my way."

A prospect

may value the results you offer, but avoid deciding because of what it takes to get them.

Like they would, but only if they could change core parts about the product... and still

get the offered result.

We could just as easily have called this the "I want to have my cake

and eat it too" argument.

What To Do About It: We explain that doing things their way probably led them to

their current problems.

And that this means their preferences actually get in the way of

achieving the result they want.

They solve this problem either by sacrificing the result they

want or the preferences that keep them from getting it... And we help them decide which

is more important to them.

These sound like:

44

"This isn't right for me"

**PAGE 45**

WHEN THEY TAKE THE BLAME

"I don't like this specific thing"

. "Can you change this part I don't like?"

Isolate And Solve.

You say: What specifically would make it for you vs. not for you? Isolate and Solve.

Always start here.

"We Vote With Our Dollars About The Things That We Care About"

You say: Totally get it. Can I offer a different lens?

(yes)... Well... we vote with

our dollars about the things that we care about right?

If you show me what someone is

spending their money and their time on, I can tell you what their future is.

I'll tell you an

interesting story. I had somebody who was just like you who was like, *You know what, I

don't want to do this either.* I told her this story.

Can I tell it to you? Yes.

I was with Leila and we went to Sephora, which is a makeup store.

I saw these two

little girls not older than 13. They were giggly and so excited.

A sales clerk helped them

out explaining the products to them, "Okay, this is eyeliner, this is lipstick, this blush and

so on."

The girls were so excited. Then, right before she hands it to them she says, "Girls,

you have to remember, now that you're getting older and you're becoming women, you

need to start budgeting for this stuff. You're going to start buying this every month, so

remember, you've got to save some money for this so you can have it."

So the young girls

are thinking, "Yes, we're becoming women now, and these are the things that women do."

When you have a new identity, you have new priorities. You've had priorities that are

aligned with your old identity.

There's the you that goes out, the you that drinks, the you

that does the blah blah blah, spends money on shit you shouldn't do, spends time on shit

you shouldn't be spending time on.

There's the you that you want to be. Right now, we

can draw the line in the sand and be like, "Do you want to keep walking down the road

that you have been walking?"

If you don't, then you have to step into a new identity. With

that new identity comes new priorities.

B2B ALTERNATE: People who want to be rich spend money on themselves. They

spend money on education.

They invest in their skill sets because they want to align their

identity with the identity of those who came before them, who've done the things they

want to do.

Just like those little girls stepping into that identity, we too must step into the

identity that we want to be.

Does that make sense?

"Pain Of Change Is Less Than The Pain Of Staying The Same"

You say: Can I share something I've learned from watching countless people succeed

and fail?

We change when the pain of staying the same is higher than the pain of change.

what I'm hearing is that you like what's going on in your life now more than the pain

of change.

And if that's true, then you are ordering yourself more of what you've already

got.

But from everything you've told me, that doesn't seem like what you really want, is it?

Or is there something else you're afraid of?

"You Gotta Change To Change"

You say: Totally hear you. We've got an internal motto for successful customers. Mind

if I share it with you?

(nod) You gotta change to change. What you have been doing has

been getting you what you've been getting, and you gotta change to change.

I remember

I would go through meal plans with people, and they'd be like, "Well, can we change this

because this is what I eat for breakfast?"

or "Can we just make that for breakfast?" And I'd

say, "That breakfast makes you look like you."

That way you spend your first four hours

of the day... makes your bank account look the way it looks.

The thing is that it's going

to hurt to change because change hurts.

The question is whether the pain of staying the

same is greater than the pain of change.

If it is, then let's do it. If it's not, then things may need to get worse before it hurts

enough to get better.

(Nudge) Listen, we know this works, this way. And if we change the variables, we

change the outcomes.

You gotta change to change.

"Change The Variables-Change The Outcome"

You say: We TOTALLY could change this thing you don't like, but... then you'd

probably also get an outcome you don't like.

So I wouldn't feel ethical offering that to

you. Here's the main point: we know these variables, in this order, create this outcome.

And if you change the variables, you change the outcome. You want this outcome right?

Then this is the best way we know how to get you there.

"The Mechanic Close"

They ask a very specific question or a question that you don't know the answer to that's

personal to them.

**PAGE 47**

WHEN THEY TAKE THE BLAME

You say: That's a great question. For me to answer it, I'd need to know more about

your business and know more about how we're going to specifically help you.

It would

be kinda like asking the person scheduling you at a mechanic shop telling you what's

wrong with your car before bringing your car in. The only way we'd be able to answer

that specifically is after our team of specialists look under the hood.

And to be clear-if

anyone does give you an answer to that question-run the other way, because there's no

way they could know that before they get to know [you/your body/your business] better.

"Surgeon Secretary Close"

Alternate: "Honestly, for me to answer that would be like a secretary at a heart

surgeon's office trying to tell you what the doctor is gonna do. It's beyond my scope and

frankly, it would do you a disservice. But thankfully, the people on our team will be able

to get you a very detailed answer the moment we get you in."

"What Would Make It A No?"

You say: Totally understand you want to think it over.

If you don't mind my asking...

what would make this a no?

This is especially useful for people who seem to be indecisive.

Rather than getting

them to say yes... try and get them to decide on what makes it a no.

If they can't decide

on what makes it a no, or the reasons they give are weak, it's much easier to then point

to the idea that they're simply unsure.

And, that makes them just like every other great

customer you've ever sold.

"Don't Repeat The Same Mistake That Got You Here"

You say: I definitely don't want you to feel an ounce of urgency, but... do you think

maybe you're in this situation because you've delayed making the decision?

Do you think

it would be a bigger mistake to make the same decision again?

"How Much Has Not Making This Decision Cost You?"

You say: Totally understand. May I share something I shared with someone yesterday

that helped them reframe the decision?

(nod) Great. I think the question isn't what it

costs you, but how much has it cost you to not decide up to this point?

Right? The cost

of inaction. I think that when we think about our lives in reverse, we never regret the

things that we did;

we regret the things we didn't do, the opportunities that we let pass by.

And think about all the years of your life you've already lived that you could've had this

improvement in your life.

Isn't that worth starting as soon as possible?

"Another Year of Almost"

You say: I hear you. Can I share something our CEO said to our company that

changed my perspective on taking action?

(nod) No one wants another year of "almost"...

do you?

Here's what I mean... another year of almost hitting your goals, of almost getting

to 10k a month, of almost hiring the team that you wanted, of almost retiring your wife

or husband, or almost moving into the neighborhood that you wanted to move into, or

almost being able to pay for your kids' recreational sports rather than not being able to

because you can't afford it?

Well, if you're tired of another year of almost, then we can't

do what we're doing to get here for another year because we're going to get another year

of almost.

And I'm pretty sure that's not where you wanna be.

So what about a 'this is my

year kinda year for a change?

WHEN THEY TAKE THE BLAME

"It Doesn't Take Time To Make Decisions It Takes Information"

You say: I think that's wise. Let's walk through the decision variables together.

After

all, you're

not going to go home, sit in the rocking chair, stare at the wall and think 'hmm,

to do this program?

No, of course not. You're gonna get in your car, and

am I going

then

you're going to realize you got to

groceries, you got to cook, you got to clean, you got to

pick up Timmy from soccer practice, you got to get

got to do all these things, right?

Then three, four, five days from now, you're going to put

pick up, you know, go do laundry,

on that old pair of jeans [INSERT ASSOCIATED PAIN), and it's not going to fit, and

you're like, crap.

Right there, you'll have made the decision. You'll keep living your life.

Let's just make it now because the reality is that it doesn't take time to make decisions.

It takes information.

I'm the only source of information you got, so let's talk. I'm here

to help.

"The Gameplan" Close

You say: I totally get why you'd hesitate to make a decision.

Mind if I share something

that might make you feel better about it?

(yes) Great... has anyone walked you through

how to decide on an X program before? No?

Well I can walk you through it right

now so you can know you made the right decision.

There are three things that we got

to understand:

1) Do you think this will help you get you closer to your goals? Yes or no?

They're

going to say yes.

2) Do you have access to the amount of money to get started? Yes or no?

They're going

to say yes. If they say no ask if they know someone who has access (resourcefulness >

resources).

Because the real world is if I was giving you a Ferrari right now for five

thousand dollars, you'd find the money.

If your landlord needed you to come up

with ten thousand dollars because you had back rent and payroll, you'd find the

money.

So, find the money, let's do it.

3) Do you think I/we can help you do this better than on your own? Yes or no?

They're going to say yes.

"This Isn't A Fast Decision"

You say: Totally understand you don't want to make a fast decision.

Have you

considered that maybe this isn't a fast decision at all?

After all... you kinda made this

decision years ago, you're just doing something about it now. And you've already come

Guarantee Closes

The following closes only work if you offer a guarantee.

These closes are very effective

because they underpin the obvious truth that they take on greater risk by deciding not to

buy than choosing to buy.

When people say they can't make a decision, it sounds like...

•

"I just need more information"

"Can you send me an email with all this summarized?"

"Let me think about it"

"I'll call you tomorrow"

"Both Options Are Risk Free"

You say: Super reasonable. That being said, I've got good news and I've got bad

news.

The bad news is you can't really make an informed decision until you've actually

tried it. Everything else is guessing.

The good news is, you can try it risk free.

So, I'm

not even asking you to make a decision right now.

I'm just actually asking you to make

an informed decision, which you can only do once you try it.

If after 30 days I'm not

what I said, this product doesn't do what I told you, I didn't fulfill my promise, or you

don't think it's going to work for you, you let me know, I'll give you the money back.

No

questions asked.

"Decadere"

You say: Totally understand. Can I share something cool with you that helped me

make a decision a while back?

(nod) Do you know where the word decide comes from?

It's Latin for de-cadere which means to kill off, or cut off. Doing this is a decision.

Not

doing this is a decision. So the question is, which future are you cutting off?

The one

where you get closer to your goals or the one where you get further away?

WHEN THEY TAKE THE BLAME

"You're Not Gonna Struggle Forever Right?"

You say: That brings up a great question I asked another customer just like you earlier

today that reframed this decision for them.

Mind if I ask you the same thing? (nod) Great.

You're not going to keep struggling forever right?

Then if you're going to do it eventually,

might as well do it now and get the benefits sooner.

Best time to plant

ago, the second best time is now.

a tree was 20 years

"Closer or Further"

You say: That's a fair point. Let me ask you a related question.

If you keep doing what

you're currently doing for five years, what does life look like?

Do you think that making

the decision is going to help you get closer or further from your goal?

That's it. Because if

we keep making decisions that keep getting us closer, we will get there eventually.

But if

we make decisions that get us further away, we'll never get there.

Do you think that this

is going to get you closer to your goal than what you're currently doing? Yes.

What are we

waiting for? We don't need to be snipers; we need to be directionally right.

We do that

long enough, we'll get there. Does that make sense?

(Nudge) That helps you too because we have this fear of perfectionism. "Is this going

to be the one?"

Probably not, but it will get you way closer. I can tell you there's no one

program/service/product that changed my life, but the decision to invest in the first one

changed my life forever.

Does that make sense?

Why You Should Take The Time To Train Closing

Closing is the big game. It's where you either win or lose.

It's how you play when the

game is on the line. Do great-and become a business legend.

Do poorly and have your

business fizzle into obscurity. Here's a little wrap up of why this is worth doing right.

When you learn how to close the right way, you...

Decrease your cost of getting customers

You improve your Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS) of all campaigns

• You get better customers who are more skeptical

• You improve cash flow (more Paid In Fulls and fewer payment plans)

Get better customer results because they are fully bought in

• Out-execute competitors in the same market as you with the same services

• Keep closers longer

Get better paid salespeople because they make you more money-everyone wins

When you close the wrong way, you...

• Ward off good customers

0 Pay more for every customer

• Make it harder to stay profitable on advertising campaigns

• Create more friction to scaling

. Get customers worse results because they're not bought in

Extend out your cash flow-what should've been a prepayment becomes an

extended payment term (and sometimes results in non payment)

You lose good salespeople because they aren't making enough
